# Benchmark

This is a Multi-Lingual repository for benchmarking different languages in different levels and compiler optimizations 

## Competitors
* C
* C++
* Java
* Rust
* Python
   * Python-C Extension
   * Python-C++ Extension
   * Python-Rust Extension

As we can see this mainly focuses around Python because we can highly decrease runtime of our routines

## Current Winners
**Overall Winner**
:medal_military::trophy: Python-C Ectension

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** 
   :1st_place_medal: Python-C Extension
  :2nd_place_medal:Java

**N-Queens**
   :1st_place_medal:Python-Rust Extension
   :2nd_place_medal: Python-C Extension

## Installation
The source-codes are present in respective Task Folders and we can reun them with the help of `run_me.ps1` for windows and `run_me.sh` for you know ... :)


## Usage

```bash
run_me.sh -task_length -type
```
`task_length` determins the length/complexicity of task
`type` is for return type i.e ```time or results```
